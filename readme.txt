Thumbs Rating does what you'd expect. It allows you to add a thumbs up/down to your content (posts, pages, custom post types...).

== Description ==

I needed a simple and light plugin to add Thumbs Rating, I couldn't find any so I built my own.

This plugin allows you to add a thumb up/down rating to your content. You can set it up to show anywhere you want, check the Installation tab.

The output is very basic, no images, no fonts, no fancy CSS. Customize the ouput overriding the CSS classes in your __style.css__ file.

= Features =

*   Stores the votes values for each content.
*   No output printed by default, check the Installation tab.
*   Easy to customize the output using CSS.

= Requests =

Feel free to post a request but let's keep it simple and light.

= Patches are welcome =

I welcome any contributions to the plugin. At long as we keep it light and simple.

Add some love on Github https://github.com/quicoto/thumbs-rating

== Installation ==

First of all activate the Plugin, then:

A) If you want to show the thumbs after your content (posts, pages, custom post types) paste this snippet at the end of your __functions.php__ file of your theme:

`function thumbs_rating_print($content)
{
	return $content.thumbs_rating_getlink();
}
add_filter('the_content', thumbs_rating_print);`

B) Alternatively you can print the Thumbs in certain parts of your theme. Paste the following snippet wherever you want it to show:

`<?=function_exists('thumbs_rating_getlink') ? thumbs_rating_getlink() : ''?>`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I activated the plugin and nothing shows =

You must specify where do you want to show the thumbs, check out the Installation instructions.

Absolutely. Check out the CSS within the plugin (__thumbs-rating/css/style.css__) and override the classes from your theme __style.css__ file.
